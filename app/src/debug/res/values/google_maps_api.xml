    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=5B:FB:C9:B0:59:E5:46:4A:4D:35:33:55:E8:0E:97:45:1B:27:1D:D3%3Bandroidmapsdefinitivo.android.bajaintec.com.androidmapsdefinitivo

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    5B:FB:C9:B0:59:E5:46:4A:4D:35:33:55:E8:0E:97:45:1B:27:1D:D3;androidmapsdefinitivo.android.bajaintec.com.androidmapsdefinitivo

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
